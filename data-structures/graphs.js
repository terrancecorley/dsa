// * What is a graph?
// A graph consists of nodes and connections (edges) between them

// * What are some examples that may use graphs?
// social networks
// recommendations 
// map routing 

// * Essential graph terms
// Vertex - a node
// Edge - connection between nodes
// Weighted/Unweighted - values assigned to distances between vertices
// Directed/Undirected - directions assigned to distances between vertices

// A Tree can only have one path from one node to another
// Undirected graphs are two-way connections
// Directed graphs are often represented with arrows defining their direction to other nodes
// A weighted graph has edges that contain values
// We can use an adjacency matrix to represent a graph
// We can also use an adjacency list to represent a graph 

// * Adjacency List Pros
// Can take up less space (in sparse graphs)
// Faster to iterate over all the edges

// * Adjacency List Cons
// Can be slower to look up specific edge

// * Adjacency Matrix Pros
// Faster to look up specific edge

// * Adjacency Matrix Cons
// Takes up more space (in sparse graphs)
// Slower to iterate over all edges
